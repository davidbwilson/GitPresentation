### Git Internals Presentation

As developers, effective use of version control is a critical part of our workflow and productivity.  Modern distributed version control systems offer more features and flexibility than previous centralized systems.  One of the most frequently used distributed source control systems is Git.  

In this presentation we will look under the hood of Git to help us understand how it stores our content and tracks history.  Understanding these fundamental concepts of Git allows us to leverage some of its advanced features as well as use it effectively to improve our productivity.  Weâ€™ll use some of the low-level plumbing commands and take a close look at the object repository to learn how it stores and tracks content.
